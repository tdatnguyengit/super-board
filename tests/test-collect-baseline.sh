# Baseline regression suite for super-collect-file.sh, driven by the ticket fixtures in
# tests/fixtures/collect/tickets/. Pins today's behaviour of: fingerprint dedupe (open hit →
# "Seen again" comment, closed-only → recurrence ticket), ticket-format rejection, the
# no-holding-column refusal (exit 65), and the PostHog tracking-gap ticket shape.
# Deterministic, no network: `gh` is a stub on PATH; the real QA / review filers run under it.
#
# `xfail` checks pin a behaviour SKILL.md promises that the code does not deliver yet: they
# print XFAIL and do not fail the suite; once the bug is fixed they print XPASS and fail, so
# the check gets promoted to a plain one.
